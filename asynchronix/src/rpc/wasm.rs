//! WASM simulation service.
//!
//! This module provides [`WasmSimulationService`], a thin wrapper over a
//! [`SimulationService`] that can be use from JavaScript.
//!
//! Although it is readily possible to use a
//! [`Simulation`](crate::simulation::Simulation) object from WASM,
//! [`WasmSimulationService`] goes further by exposing the complete simulation
//! API to JavaScript through protobuf.
//!
//! Keep in mind that WASM only supports single-threaded execution and therefore
//! any simulation bench compiled to WASM should instantiate simulations with
//! either [`SimInit::new()`](crate::simulation::SimInit::new) or
//! [`SimInit::with_num_threads(1)`](crate::simulation::SimInit::with_num_threads),
//! failing which the simulation will panic upon initialization.
//!
//! [`WasmSimulationService`] is exported to the JavaScript namespace as
//! `SimulationService`, and [`WasmSimulationService::process_request`] as
//! `SimulationService.processRequest`.

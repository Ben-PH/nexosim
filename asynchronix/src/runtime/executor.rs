/// A multi-threaded `async` executor.
///
/// The executor is exclusively designed for message-passing computational
/// tasks. As such, it does not include an I/O reactor and does not consider
/// fairness as a goal in itself. While it does use fair local queues inasmuch
/// as these tend to perform better in message-passing applications, it uses an
/// unfair injection queue and a LIFO slot without attempt to mitigate the
/// effect of badly behaving code (e.g. futures that spin-lock by yielding to
/// the executor; there is for this reason no support for something like tokio's
/// `yield_now`).
///
/// Another way in which it differs from other `async` executors is that it
/// treats deadlocking as a normal occurrence. This is because in a
/// discrete-time simulator, the simulation of a system at a given time step
/// will make as much progress as possible until it technically reaches a
/// deadlock. Only then does the simulator advance the simulated time until the
/// next "event" extracted from a time-sorted priority queue.
///
/// The design of the executor is largely influenced by the tokio and go
/// schedulers, both of which are optimized for message-passing applications. In
/// particular, it uses fast, fixed-size thread-local work-stealing queues with
/// a "fast" non-stealable slot in combination with a global injector queue. The
/// injector queue is used both to schedule new tasks and to absorb temporary
/// overflow in the local queues. The design of the injector queue is kept very
/// simple by taking advantage of the fact that the injector is not required to
/// be either LIFO or FIFO.
///
/// Probably the largest difference with tokio is the task system, which
/// achieves a higher throughput by reducing the need for synchronization.
/// Another difference is that, at the moment, the complete subset of active
/// worker threads is stored in a single atomic variable. This makes it possible
/// to rapidly identify free worker threads for stealing operations. The
/// downside of this approach is that the maximum number of worker threads is
/// limited to `usize::BITS`, but this is unlikely to constitute a limitation
/// since system simulation is not typically embarrassingly parallel.

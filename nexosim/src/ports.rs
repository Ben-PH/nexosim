//! Model ports for event and query broadcasting.
//!
//! Models typically contain [`Output`] and/or [`Requestor`] ports, exposed as
//! public member variables. Output ports broadcast events to all connected
//! input ports, while requestor ports broadcast queries to, and retrieve
//! replies from, all connected replier ports.
//!
//! On the surface, output and requestor ports only differ in that sending a
//! query from a requestor port also returns an iterator over the replies from
//! all connected ports. Sending a query is more costly, however, because of the
//! need to wait until all connected models have processed the query. In
//! contrast, since events are buffered in the mailbox of the target model,
//! sending an event is a fire-and-forget operation. For this reason, output
//! ports should generally be preferred over requestor ports when possible.
//!
//! `Output` and `Requestor` ports are clonable. Their clones are shallow
//! copies, meaning that any modification of the ports connected to one clone is
//! immediately reflected in other clones.
//!
//! #### Example
//!
//! This example demonstrates two submodels inside a parent model. The output of
//! the submodel and of the main model are clones and remain therefore always
//! connected to the same inputs.
//!
//! For a more comprehensive example demonstrating hierarchical model
//! assemblies, see the [`assembly example`][assembly].
